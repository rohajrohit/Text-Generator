# Text-Generator with Neural Network in Keras

## Overview
This project leverages the power of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, implemented using the Keras deep learning library, to generate human-like text. LSTM networks are particularly well-suited for text generation tasks due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies and generate coherent and contextually relevant text. Whether you're interested in generating stories, poetry, or any other creative written content, this project provides a solid foundation for text generation.

## Key Features
LSTM-Based Text Generation: Utilizes LSTM networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to generate text sequences that exhibit coherence and contextuality.
Keras Framework: Built on the Keras deep learning library, which offers a user-friendly and high-level API for neural network design and training.
Customizable Training: Allows training on your own text data, making it adaptable to a wide range of text generation tasks.
Seeded Text Generation: Provides the flexibility to start text generation with a seed text, enabling you to influence the initial context.

## Results
The LSTM model generates text that closely resembles the training data. You can achieve various text generation tasks with this model, from creating captivating stories to crafting poetic verses.
